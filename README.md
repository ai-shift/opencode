# OpenCode Go Library

A Go library for programmatically controlling OpenCode. Provides a type-safe client for starting OpenCode instances, managing sessions, sending messages, and receiving streaming responses with strongly-typed events based on the OpenAPI specification.

Enables building AI-powered applications that leverage Claude's capabilities through isolated OpenCode sessions with full control over configuration and session persistence.
